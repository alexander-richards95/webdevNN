Neural networks for the web

Applications for Neural Networks in Web development can be:- 
1. Cybersecurity
    Identifying patterns and vulnerable websites based on trends can help prevent attacks and minimize liabilities.
2. Gamification of Websites:

    In this article we can see the author create an ANN to recognize hand-drawn fruits and redirect to the correct produce for that      user.
3.Front-end Web Development
    In terms of front-end web development, the training data would be GUI screenshots (pix2code) or hand-drawn components (sketch2code). The data would also include code for the screenshots or hand-drawn images. This requires a great deal of computing power.
