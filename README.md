Neural networks for the web

Applications for Neural Networks in Web development can be:- 
1. Cybersecurity
    Identifying patterns and vulnerable websites based on trends can help prevent attacks and minimize liabilities.
2. Gamification of Websites:

    In this article we can see the author create an ANN to recognize hand-drawn fruits and redirect to the correct produce for that      user.
3.Front-end Web Development
    In terms of front-end web development, the training data would be GUI screenshots (pix2code) or hand-drawn components (sketch2code). The data would also include code for the screenshots or hand-drawn images. This requires a great deal of computing power.

  FOR anyone trying to code this the small paragraph below is introductory.
Within three years deep learning will change front-end development. It will increase prototyping speed and lower the barrier for building software.

The field took off last year when Tony Beltramelli introduced the pix2code paper and Airbnb launched sketch2code.

Currently, the largest barrier to automating front-end development is computing power. However, we can use current deep learning algorithms, along with synthesized training data, to start exploring artificial front-end automation right now.

In this post, weâ€™ll teach a neural network how to code a basic a HTML and CSS website based on a picture of a design mockup. Here's a quick overview of the process:
1) Give a design image to the trained neural networkimg
2) The neural network converts the image into HTML markup
3) Rendered output
